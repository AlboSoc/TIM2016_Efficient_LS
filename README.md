Source files for Efficient Implementation of Least Squares Sine Fitting Algorithms in IEEE Transactions on Instrumantation and Measurement 2016

- LS_3PF  - Evaluates 3-parameter LS fitting. Elements in matrix D0_T * D0 are calculated directly based on the closed form of sums

- LS_3PF_offset -  Evaluates 3-parameter LS fitting with time offsetting. Elements in matrix D0_T * D0 are calculated directly based on the closed form of sums

- LS_4PF_offset   Evaluates 4-parameter LS fitting with time offsetting. Elements in matrix D0_T * D0 are calculated directly based on the closed form of sums

- monte_carlo_4PF - Monte Carlo simulation for the four-parameter fitting problem

- scaling_4PF - Checks the condition number of the 4PF problem for different scaling factors
